## About
This is, well... Tic Tac Toe! I made this app as a side project to try out some new stuff and practice coding.

Here's what I've used:
- **Vanilla JS**, because I enjoy the from-scratch nature of it.
- **Service Workers** and **cache storage**, to make the app available offline.
- **MVC design pattern**. It keeps things nice and tidy by decoupling the rendering of the app from the implementation of the game itself.
- **Event design pattern**, as the method of communication between the view and the model.
- **Minimax algorithm**, for the game's artificial intelligence.

## Running It
Clone the repository, make sure you have npm installed and run:
```
npm i && npm run start
```
Open your browser and go to `localhost:3000`
