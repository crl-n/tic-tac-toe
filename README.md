# Tic Tac Toe

This is, well... Tic Tac Toe! I made this app as a side project to try out some new stuff and practice coding.

Here's what I've used:
- **Vanilla JS**, because I enjoy the from-scratch nature of it.
- **Service Workers** and **cache storage**, to make the app available offline.

### Coming Up
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search**. I plan to use it to create an AI you can play against. I also plan to add the option of making two AI players play against each other.
